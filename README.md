### rai's scripts
python things to help me use the computer

how to use:
1. make sure the top-level comment on each script matches the output of `which python`
2. create a symlink to each script you want to use in `~/.local/bin`
    - whatever you name the symlink will be what you type in the console to run the script!
3. have fun!
